## Subscription Billing System

This Java program simulates an automated billing system for a subscription streaming service. The system calculates and generates monthly invoices for subscribers, factoring in a fixed monthly fee and a 5% maintenance charge on each payment.

**Features:**

* **Customer Subscription Processing:** Takes customer information (name, email) and desired subscription length (in months) as input.
* **Monthly Invoice Generation:**  Calculates and generates individual invoices for each month of the subscription period, incorporating:
    * **Base Subscription Fee:**  A fixed amount set by the user.
    * **Maintenance Fee:** 5% of the base fee is added to each month's bill.
* **Interface-Driven Design:** Utilizes interfaces to abstract payment calculation methods, allowing for potential flexibility to incorporate different subscription types or promotions in the future.
* **Invoice Representation:** Employs a dedicated `Invoice` class to represent individual monthly bills, ensuring clear organization of billing data. 

**How It Works:**

1.  **Input:**  The program takes the customer's name, email, subscription fee, and desired subscription duration as input.
2.  **Invoice Calculation and Generation:** The system calculates the monthly invoice amount, including the maintenance fee. It then generates a detailed invoice for each month of the subscription period.
3.  **Output:**  The program displays the generated invoices, providing a clear breakdown of charges for each month.

**Purpose:**

This program demonstrates the use of object-oriented principles, including interfaces for abstraction, to build a maintainable and extensible billing system. It exemplifies practical application of Java in managing and automating financial processes.

**Potential Enhancements:**

*   **GUI Implementation:**  Develop a user interface for more interactive customer and subscription management.
*   **Payment Processing Integration:** Integrate with payment gateways to simulate real-world transaction processing.
*   **Database Persistence:**  Implement a database to store and manage customer, subscription, and invoice data. 
*   **Promotional Logic:**  Incorporate logic to handle discounts or promotional offers, further utilizing the interface-driven design for payment calculation.

This project aims to provide a basic yet functional model of a subscription billing system, highlighting key Java concepts and their application in a real-world scenario.
